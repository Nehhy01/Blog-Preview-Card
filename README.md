## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This project was a simple one.
I learnt a great CSS trick. The difference between an instance like this:
div p {

}

and 

div > p {

}

The former style applies to all p-tags in the div including those inside a sub tag.
The latter only applies to p-tags directly inside the div-tag.


Another thing i learnt was interepreting a figma file for my development.
I extracted useful info like font size, spacing, color withoud depending on the /asset folder that came with this starter folder.
It was fun :)
